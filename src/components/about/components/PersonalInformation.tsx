          I have experience working with agile methodologies like Scrum, using
          tools such as Jira and Trello for effective project management. I've

          challenges, applying modern development practices and clean
          architecture principles.

          I'm actively seeking opportunities where I can contribute to impactful
          back-end systems, continue learning, and grow professionally. If
